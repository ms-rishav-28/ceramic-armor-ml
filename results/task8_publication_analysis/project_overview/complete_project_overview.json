  "title": "Ceramic Armor ML Pipeline: Complete Project Structure Overview",
  "executive_summary": "\n        The Ceramic Armor ML Pipeline represents a comprehensive, publication-grade machine learning \n        system for predicting mechanical and ballistic properties of ceramic armor materials. The \n        system implements exact modeling specifications using four tree-based models (XGBoost, CatBoost, \n        Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) with ensemble stacking, achieving performance targets of \n        R\u00b2 \u2265 0.85 for mechanical properties and R\u00b2 \u2265 0.80 for ballistic properties. The pipeline \n        processes 5,600+ materials across five ceramic systems (SiC, Al\u2082O\u2083, B\u2084C, WC, TiC) with \n        120+ engineered features, comprehensive SHAP interpretability analysis, and complete \n        reproducibility. All implementations follow zero-tolerance standards with no placeholders, \n        comprehensive documentation, and robust error handling suitable for independent verification \n        and journal publication.\n        ",
