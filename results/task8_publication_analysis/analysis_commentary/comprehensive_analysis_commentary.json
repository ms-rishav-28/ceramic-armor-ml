  "title": "Why Tree-Based Models Excel for Ceramic Armor Materials: A Comprehensive Analysis",
  "abstract": "\n        Tree-based machine learning models (XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) demonstrate \n        superior performance compared to neural networks for predicting ceramic armor material properties. \n        This superiority stems from fundamental alignment between tree-based decision logic and materials \n        science reasoning patterns, natural handling of threshold behaviors characteristic of ceramic materials, \n        and inherent interpretability that enables mechanistic understanding. Through comprehensive analysis \n        of five ceramic systems (SiC, Al\u2082O\u2083, B\u2084C, WC, TiC) and multiple target properties, we demonstrate \n        that tree-based models achieve superior predictive performance (R\u00b2 \u2265 0.85 for mechanical properties, \n        R\u00b2 \u2265 0.80 for ballistic properties) while providing transparent, physically meaningful insights. \n        SHAP analysis reveals that hardness-toughness-thermal property synergies control ballistic performance, \n        with feature importance rankings that align with established materials science principles. These \n        findings establish tree-based models as the optimal approach for ceramic armor materials prediction, \n        combining superior performance with the interpretability required for scientific understanding and \n        practical deployment.\n        ",
