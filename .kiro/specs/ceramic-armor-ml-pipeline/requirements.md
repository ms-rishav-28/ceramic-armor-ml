# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for **completing and fixing critical gaps** in an existing publication-ready machine learning pipeline to predict mechanical and ballistic properties of ceramic armor materials. The existing codebase has most components implemented but requires specific fixes and completions to address import errors, missing implementations, and integration issues. The system must deliver a complete, working implementation suitable for top-tier journal publication (Acta Materialia, Materials & Design).

## Glossary

- **ML_Pipeline**: The complete machine learning pipeline system for ceramic armor property prediction
- **Data_Collector**: Components responsible for gathering materials data from external APIs
- **Feature_Engineer**: System components that calculate derived material properties
- **Model_Trainer**: Components that train and validate machine learning models
- **SHAP_Analyzer**: System component for model interpretability analysis
- **Config_System**: Configuration management system for the pipeline
- **Logger_System**: Centralized logging system for the entire pipeline
- **Validation_System**: Components that verify system functionality and data quality
- **Windows_Environment**: Windows 11 Pro 64-bit operating system environment
