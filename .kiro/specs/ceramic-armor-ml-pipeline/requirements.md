# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for **elevating an existing machine learning pipeline to publication-grade standards** for predicting mechanical and ballistic properties of ceramic armor materials. The system currently has 47 passing tests but 31 failing tests that must be resolved. The pipeline must achieve zero tolerance for approximation, deliver reproducible results, and meet strict performance targets (R² ≥ 0.85 for mechanical, R² ≥ 0.80 for ballistic properties) suitable for top-tier journal publication (Acta Materialia, Materials & Design, Nature Materials).
